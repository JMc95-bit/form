        Social engineering attacks arenâ€™t solely reserved for online and phone interactions. Some originate in the physical world. <br>
        Baiting can be acheived both online and in the physical world <br>
        Baiting offline refers to when an attacker leaves a device, such as a usb, that contains malicious code out in the open in the hopes that someone will find it and plug it into either their personal or business device allowing them access to the data on those devices and access to the networks they are conencted to. <br>
        This could have significant repercussions especially if it is plugged into a business device that is linked to a company's whole network. <br>
        An example of baiting online is when attackers use disingenuous tempting adverts as gateways to websites that conatin malware. Adverts that state "click now for a great deal on a holiday" etc. that are too enticing and too good to be true are often examples of online baiting. <br>

    <h2>Ways to prevent Baiting</h2>
    <p>Ways to protect yourself from baiting attacks both off and online include: <br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>STOP and think. Take a moment to consider the situation before reacting.</li>
        <li>Don't take any links you receive at face value, verify if a company is legitimate before clicking any adverts.<br>
        This can be done by searching the name of the company on the advert in a search engine, such as google, and reading the reviews. </li>
        <li>Don't plug in any external storage devices that you find, if you come across a USB or external hard drive in the office in a place where it wouldn't be expected such as the break room, report it to management, do not plug it in to your device. </li>
        <li>Make sure that your antivirus and antimalware software on your device is up to date.</li>
