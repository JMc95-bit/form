    <h2>What is Baiting?</h2>
    <p>
        Social engineering attacks arenâ€™t solely reserved for online and phone interactions. Some originate in the physical world. <br>
        Baiting can be acheived both online and in the physical world <br>
        Baiting offline refers to when an attacker leaves a device, such as a usb, that contains malicious code out in the open in the hopes that someone will find it and plug it into either their personal or business device allowing them access to the data on those devices and access to the networks they are conencted to. <br>
        This could have significant repercussions especially if it is plugged into a business device that is linked to a company's whole network. By plugging an infected external drive into a networked computer the entire network that it is connected to is at risk. <br>
        Gaining access to any level of a system can allow an attacker to gain further access to the system using the information they have learned from thier initial breach.<br>
        <br>
        An example of baiting online is when attackers use fraudulent tempting adverts as gateways to websites that conatin malware. The attackers aim is to tempt an individual into clicking one of these fake adverts, redirecting them to thier web page where they will steal their data and/or finanical information<br>
        Adverts that state "click now for a great deal on a holiday" etc. that are too enticing and too good to be true are often examples of online baiting. 
        A common type of online baiting that the public is exposed to is "pop-ups", those annoying adverts on the side of the webpage that seem to always be advertising exacgtly what the individual wants in that moment for the best price they'll ever get it for.<br>

    <h2>Ways to prevent Baiting</h2>
    <p>Ways to protect yourself from baiting attacks both off and online include: <br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>STOP and think. Take a moment to consider the situation before reacting.</li>
        <li>Don't take any links you see at face value, verify if a company is legitimate before clicking any adverts.<br>
        This can be done by searching the name of the company on the advert in a search engine, such as google, and reading the reviews. </li>
        <li>Don't plug in any external storage devices that you find, if you come across a USB or external hard drive in the office in a place where it wouldn't be expected such as the break room, report it to management, do not plug it in to your device. </li>
        <li>Make sure that your antivirus and antimalware software on your device is up to date.</li>
        

    </ul>
    <p>
        If you feel you've been the victim of a baiting attack report it to the police, or a fraud prevention site such as action fraud.
