        A quid pro quo attack is where an attacker is offering a benefit such as a service in return for access to sensitive information<br>
        It is often disguised as the target getting something they want whilst in actuality it's the attacker thats getting what they want.<br>
        For example, a fake IT help scenario in a business setting could be the attacker presenting as an IT help technician, whilst withholding the help required until the target provides a password or remote access to their device. <br>
