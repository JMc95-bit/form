    <h2>What is Smishing?</h2>
    <p>
        Smishing attacks are similar to both phishing and vishing, however it is presented through text messages. <br>
        Smishing attacks are typically aiming to gain personal information from the receiver that the attacker can then use to do such things as break passwords to any online accounts that the victim may have.<br>
        Smishing relies on emotional manipulation in a few ways; it can target stress and urgency or it can target need. These attempts at emotional manipulation are used with the intention of making the target react with impulse and not think through what they are doing. <br>
        With the rise of Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) in companies, smishing is becoming a threat to companies as well as individuals.<br>

    </p>
    <h2>Ways to prevent Smishing</h2>
    <p>
        Ways to mitigate a smishing attack include: <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>STOP and think, again the best piece of advice to protect yourself from social engineering attacks is to not react on instinct. Stop and think before acting. </li>
        <li>Don't respond to any text messages that come through from unknown numbers without confirming who the sender is,<br>
         this can be done by looking up the phone number in a search engine such as google, or if you have a smart device, use apps such as TrueCaller which will flag any known scam phone numbers and can add them to a blocked list so they cannot contact you.</li>
        <li>This is an example of a potential smishing message: </li>
        <img src="https://github.com/JMc95-bit/form/blob/main/Smishing_example.jpeg?raw=true"> <br>
        This image shows a text message received from an unknown number, claiming to be from HR from some unknown company, offering a generous salary and not providing any further information just a link to follow to find out more.<br>
        The sender's aim is likely to have the recipient follow the link on the proimise of a good wage, probably to a fraudulant website where their data will be stolen and used for nefarious resaons.<br>
        There are a few key elements of this message that suggest that it may not be a legitimate contact: <br>
        As we can see; the phone number that the message was sent from is unknown to the reciepent, it is not in saved in their contacts on their phone. This is suspicious as it is not common to be receiving text messages from unknown numbers.<br>
        The contents of the message also is not very well written, this can be an indication that the message is not legitimate.<br>
        This suspicious contact is attemtping to manipulate the target into following the link provided, by offering a generous salary and not giving any further information.<br>
        <br>
        <li>Be suspicious of texts, delivery services, banks and the NHS, for example, will all send legitimate text messages with information relevant to your life, <br>
        however, social engineers know this and use it to their advantage. </li>
        <li>If you have any doubt about the validity of the text message, don't interact with it, <br>
            Block the contact number, <br>
            Report it to your network provider by forwarding the message to 7726,<br>
            Do not respond to the message.</li>
    </ul>
