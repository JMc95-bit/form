    <h2>What is Social Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        o	Social Engineering is an umbrella term referring to a wide range of actions by those with malicious intentions, through the psychological manipulation of the public, often resulting in breaches of personal and business security leaving user data vulnerable. <br>
        o	A social engineering attack would commonly be referred to as a scam by the public. <br>
        o	Social engineering attacks happen in stages. <br>
        o	Firstly, the attacker will investigate either their targeted victim, either an individual or a business, and attempt to identify points of weakness that would allow them to mount an attack. <br>
        o	Once, information has been gathered, the attacker will attempt to gain the victimâ€™s trust, if individual, or gain access to the business and try to manipulate the victim into giving them access to sensitive data. <br>
        <br>
        Research conducted by Avast found that adults over the age of 50 are more vulnerable to social engineering attacks that target thier banking and technology use. <br>
