    <h2>What is Social Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        Social Engineering is an umbrella term referring to attempts by individuals with criminal intent to use manipulation tactics to trick members of the public into revealing private information such as logins and banking information. <br>
        This often results in breaches of personal and business security which can leave user data, including financial information, vulnerable to exploitation. <br>
        Social engineering attacks are more commonly known by the public as scams. <br>
        Social engineering attacks can occur both off and online, interactions that would be commonly perceived as innocent such as someone seeing your device screen over your shoulder (shoulder surfing) on the bus or letting someone through a secure door (tailgaiting), can actually be part of a social engineering attack. <br>
    <br>
        <br>
        Social engineering attacks happen in stages: <br>
    <dl>
        <dt>Firstly, the attacker will investigate their targeted victim, either an individual or a business, and attempt to identify points of weakness that would allow them to mount an attack. </li>
       <dd> A common method used by social engineers to gather information about their targets is through viewing their social media activity. Sharing personal information with friends online can seem like an innocent and convenient way to stay in contact,
        however it is advised to take care with the type of information being shared as this can be used by an attacker to tailor thier attacks. <br>
        It is strongly advised not to share information that is commonly used as security question answers or passwords online, such as anniversaries and pets names. </dd>
        <dt>Once, information has been gathered, the attacker will attempt to gain the victimâ€™s trust, if individual, or gain access to the business and try to manipulate the victim into giving them access to sensitive data. </dt>
    </dl>
        <br>
    
        Research conducted by Avast found that adults over the age of 50 are more vulnerable to social engineering attacks that target their banking and technology use. <br>
        Therefore, this education tool will focus on five of the most common types of social engineering attacks:
    <ul>
        <li>Phishing</li>
        <li>Vishing</li>
        <li>Smishing</li>
        <li>Baiting</li>
        <li>Quid Pro Quo</li>
    </ul>
