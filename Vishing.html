        Vishing is the term used to describe scam phone calls. Attackers will phone targets and attempt to get them to reveal personal information through threats or emotional malipulation<br>
        Sometimes, the phone number will be spoofed (a different number imitating a well known one), e.g. the phone number for the tax office was being spoofed and used in vishing attacks in an attempt to trick customers into believing that they owe fines to the tax office and they have to pay. <br>
        Another example of the tax office being used in a vishing attack was an automated voice would come on the line and claim that the recipient has an outstanding fine from the tax office and have failed to pay it, as such a warrant was being issued for the arrest of the individual, however they could make it go away if they held on the line and paid whomever they would be put in contact with. This attack used fear and compliance in an attempt to manipulate the victim into sending money to the attacker. <br>
