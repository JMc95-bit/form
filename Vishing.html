    <h2>What is Vishing?</h2>    
    <p>
        Vishing is the term used to describe scam phone calls. Attackers will phone targets and attempt to get them to reveal personal information through threats, emotional malipulation or trickery<br>
        Attackers can attempt to confuse or manipulate targets on the phone, often utalising stress and urgency to prevent individuals from thinking clearly about the situation they are in and instead act implusively to resolve whichever situation the attacker claims the individual to be in.<br>
        Sometimes, the attacker will use a spoofed phone number (a different number imitating a well known one)to give more weight to their claim that they are who they are pretending to be.<br>
        One example of a spoofed phone number being used in vishing attacks occured when the phone number for HMRC was being spoofed and used in vishing attacks in an attempt to trick customers into believing that they owe fines to the tax office and they have to pay over the phone or they will be in a lot of trouble or owe even more money. <br>
        Another example of the tax office being used in a vishing attack was when an automated voice would come on the line and claim that the recipient has an outstanding fine from the tax office and have failed to pay it, as such a warrant was being issued for the arrest of the individual, however they could make it go away if they held on the line and paid whomever they would be put in contact with. This attack used fear and compliance in an attempt to manipulate the victim into sending money to the attacker. <br>

    <h2>Ways to prevent vishing attacks</h2>   
    <p>Ways to protect yourself from a vishing attack include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take your time, in the same way that this helps protect you from phishing. Stopping and taking your time to think about what is being asked of you will help to reduce the affect of the attackers emotional manipulation, and allow you to act with thought instead of reacting with impusle. </li>
        <li>Being aware that companies like your bank, the tax office etc. will not phone you without prior arrangement and will not ask you to divulge sensitive information such as passwords or bank details. </li>
        <li>Don't share any of your personal information, such as bank details and answers to security questions, over the phone. </li>
        <li>Calls from automated voices are often used by attackers to get maximum expsoure to potential victims as they are using an auto dialling service, so it is safe to assume they are illegitimate and hang up. </li>
        <li>If at any point you feel like a phone interaction is suspiscious hang up, if you are in contact with your bank or a similar type of business, contact them separately to confirm if the contact you just experienced was legitimate or not.</li><br>
        <li>If you think you have been a victim of a vishing attack report to incident to the police and sites like Action Fraud.</li>
