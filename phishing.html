        	What is Phishing?<br>
           Phishing is a type of Social Engineering attack that attempts to gain a victims money or identity, by manipulating individuals into revelaing personal infomation by following fraudulent links.<br>
           It is delivered by fraudulent emails, claiming to be from a trusted source but is sent with the intention of tricking the receiver into divulging confidential information such as bank details. <br>

    <h2>Ways to prevent phishing</h2>
    <p>
        The best piece of advice for preventing social engineering attacks is to STOP, take a minute and think about the situation you're being presented with and act with caution.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Things to look out for as indicators of a phishing email include:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Make sure that the address that an email has been sent from matches who the email claims to be from.</li>
        To do this when reading emails on a laptop, desktop or tablet; when you open the email the senders name will be visible and next to that should be the email address that sent the email. <br>
        If it has come from a company then the company name should be in the address. <br>

        <br>
        If you are viewing emails on your phone; you can click on the name of the sender and it will show you the address.<br>

        <li>Don't click on any links in emails that you're not sure are legitimate. </li>
        <li>Learn about the typical types of emails that are used as phishing and the signs to lookout for. </li>
        <li>Social engineers will often try to manipulate thier targets using urgency or trying to play on their emotions.</li>
        Emails that have a sense of urgency about them, offers that seem to good to be true with shoft time limits on them for example are often used in phishing.<br>
       <li>If you receive an email claiming to be from someone you know needing urgent financial help, try to contact that person via a method that you know is definately them and confirm if the request is genuine. </li>
        <li>If you come across an email telling you to "act now" or creates a sense of urgency, take a moment to think, "is this likely to be genuine" before you act. </li>
        <li>Be aware of emails that are received from new contacts, they won't always be phishers but again it's always best to take the time to think before you act. </li>
        <li>Poor spelling, or badly written emails can also be an indication of a phishing email. </li>
        <li>If your email provider has placed a message on the email stating that the "sender could not be verified" then it's best not to trust the email. </li>
        There may have been something that has flagged in the email header, the data sent along with the email. <br>
